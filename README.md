# 🏗️ Sales Data Warehouse - Modern ETL Pipeline

A comprehensive data warehouse solution implementing medallion architecture to consolidate and standardize sales data from multiple source systems, enabling downstream analytics and business intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Project Background

Modern businesses struggle with fragmented data across multiple systems, making unified reporting and analytics nearly impossible. This project addresses a common enterprise challenge: **integrating sales data from disparate CRM and ERP systems** into a single, reliable source of truth.

**The Challenge:**
- Sales data scattered across 6 different source systems (CRM and ERP).
- Inconsistent data formats and quality issues.
- No unified view of customer behavior, product performance, or sales trends.
- Analysts spending majority of their time on data preparation instead of analysis.

**The Solution:**
A modern data warehouse built with medallion architecture that:
- Consolidates 115,000+ records from CRM and ERP systems.
- Implements comprehensive data quality testing and validation.
- Creates analysis-ready datasets in optimized star schema.
- Provides clean, standardized data foundation for business intelligence.

This infrastructure enables analysts to focus on generating insights rather than wrestling with data integration challenges.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Technical Design

### **Medallion Architecture Implementation**

![Data Architecture](/documents/Data_Architecture.jpg)

The solution follows industry-standard **Bronze-Silver-Gold** layered architecture:

**🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)**
- **Purpose:** Store raw data exactly as received from source systems
- **Sources:** CRM (3 tables) and ERP (3 tables) systems via CSV files  
- **Processing:** Minimal transformation - load data as-is for audit trail
- **Volume:** 115,000+ records across 6 source tables

**🥈 Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Standardization)**
- **Purpose:** Clean, validate, and standardize data for consistency
- **Transformations:** Data quality fixes, standardization, deduplication
- **Quality Assurance:** 10-test validation suite ensuring data integrity
- **Output:** Clean, normalized tables ready for business logic

**🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Analytics)**
- **Purpose:** Optimized star schema for analytical workloads
- **Design:** Dimensional modeling with fact and dimension tables
- **Performance:** Indexed and partitioned for fast query response
- **Consumption:** Direct connection to BI tools and analytical workflows

### **Data Flow & Integration**

![Data Flow](/docs/ext_data_flow_diagram.jpg)

**Source System Integration:**
- **CRM System:** Customer information, product details, sales transactions
- **ERP System:** Customer demographics, location data, product categories
- **Integration Approach:** Common keys enable seamless data linking across systems

## 📊 Data Model & Schema Design

### **Star Schema Implementation**

![Star Schema](/docs/data_model.jpg)

**Dimensional Model Design:**
- **Fact Table:** `gold.fact_sales` - Core sales transactions and metrics
- **Dimension Tables:** 
  - `gold.dim_customers` - Customer demographics and attributes
  - `gold.dim_products` - Product catalog with categories and specifications

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Surrogate Keys:** Implemented for dimension table stability
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions:** Type 1 approach for current state reporting  
- **Calculated Measures:** Pre-computed sales amounts (Quantity × Price)
- **Business Rules:** Consistent data types and naming conventions

### **Data Integration Strategy**

![Data Integration](documents/Integration Model (final).jpg)

**Cross-System Linkage:**
- Customer data merged from both CRM and ERP systems
- Product information enriched with category details from ERP
- Sales transactions linked to complete customer and product profiles

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **ETL Pipeline Architecture**

**Bronze Layer Processing:**
```sql
-- Example: Raw data ingestion with minimal transformation
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE bronze.load_bronze AS
		-- Loading: bronze.crm_cust_info
		SET @start_time = GETDATE();
		PRINT '>> Truncating Table: bronze.crm_cust_info'
		TRUNCATE TABLE bronze.crm_cust_info;

		PRINT '>> Inserting Data Into Table: bronze.crm_cust_info'
		BULK INSERT bronze.crm_cust_info
		FROM '{project_path}\dataset\source_crm\cust_info.csv'
		WITH (
			FIRSTROW = 2,
			FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
			TABLOCK
		);
		SET @end_time = GETDATE();
		PRINT '>> Load Duration: ' + CAST(DATEDIFF(second, @start_time, @end_time) AS NVARCHAR) + ' seconds';
		PRINT '>> -----------'
END
```

**Silver Layer Transformations:**
```sql
-- Example: Data cleansing and standardization
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE silver.load_silver AS
BEGIN
        -- Loading silver.crm_cust_info
        SET @start_time = GETDATE();
        PRINT '>> Truncating Table: silver.crm_cust_info';
        TRUNCATE TABLE silver.crm_cust_info;

        PRINT 'Inserting Data Into: silver.crm_cust_info';
        INSERT INTO silver.crm_cust_info (
            cst_id,
            cst_key,
            cst_firstname,
            cst_lastname,
            cst_marital_status,
            cst_gndr,
            cst_create_date
        )
        -- Query for only getting unique values
        SELECT 
        cst_id,
        cst_key,
        TRIM(cst_firstname) AS cst_firstname,
        TRIM(cst_lastname) AS cst_lastname,
        -- Clarifying marital values
        CASE WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_marital_status)) = 'S' THEN 'Single'
	         WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_marital_status)) = 'M' THEN 'Married'
	         ELSE 'n/a'
        END cst_marital_status,
        -- Clarifying gender values
        CASE WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_gndr)) = 'F' THEN 'Female'
	         WHEN UPPER(TRIM(cst_gndr)) = 'M' THEN 'Male'
	         ELSE 'n/a'
        END cst_gndr,
        cst_create_date
        -- creating derived table with alias 't'. Selecting only lastest data w/o duplicates
        FROM(
	        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY cst_id ORDER BY cst_create_date DESC) as flag_last
	        FROM bronze.crm_cust_info) AS t
        WHERE flag_last = 1;
		SET @end_time = GETDATE();
		PRINT '>> Load Duration: ' + CAST(DATEDIFF(second, @start_time, @end_time) AS NVARCHAR) + ' seconds';
		PRINT '>> -----------------------------------------'
END
```

**Gold Layer Business Logic:**
```sql
-- ==================================================
-- Create Dimension: gold.dim_customers
-- ==================================================
IF OBJECT_ID ('gold.dim_customers', 'V') IS NOT NULL
	DROP VIEW gold.dim_customers;
GO

CREATE VIEW gold.dim_customers AS 
SELECT  
	ROW_NUMBER () OVER (ORDER BY cst_id) AS customer_key,-- Surrogate Key
	ci.cst_id AS customer_id,
	ci.cst_key AS customer_number,
	ci.cst_firstname AS first_name,
	ci.cst_lastname AS last_name,
	la.cntry AS country,
	ci.cst_marital_status AS marital_status,
	CASE WHEN ci.cst_gndr != 'n/a' THEN ci.cst_gndr -- CRM is the Master for gender info
		 ELSE COALESCE(ca.gen, 'n/a')				-- Fallback to ERP data
	END AS gender,
	ca.bdate AS birthdate,
	ci.cst_create_date AS create_date
FROM silver.crm_cust_info ci
LEFT JOIN silver.erp_cust_az12 ca
ON		ci.cst_key = ca.cid
LEFT JOIN silver.erp_loc_a101 la
ON		ci.cst_key = la.cid
GO
```
